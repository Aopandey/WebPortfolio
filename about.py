        I wear multiple hats‚Äîpart engineer, part problem solver. My journey from <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>India to Indiana</span> has been one of growth, resilience, and discovery, leading me to specialize in <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>AI-driven data pipelines</span>, <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>machine learning</span>, and <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>data engineering</span>. On the technical front, I build scalable ETL pipelines, optimize AI retrieval models, and design interactive data visualizations. The data-driven side of me focuses on structuring unstructured data, improving model accuracy, and bridging the gap between AI and business strategy.
        <br>
        My academic journey reflects my curiosity and adaptability. I earned a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Computer Science</span> with a <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Minor in Mathematics</span> from <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Purdue University</span>, an achievement that once felt like a distant dream. Originally starting in Computer Engineering, I soon realized that Computer Science was my true passion, leading me to pivot and explore AI, data engineering, and large-scale data processing.
        <br><br>
        <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;'>Leadership & Projects</span>
        <br><br>
        - Co-founded the Computer Science Club at Purdue Indianapolis, increasing engagement by <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>100%</span> and organizing hackathons with <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>200+ participants</span>.
        <br>
        - Mentored <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>50+ international students</span> through Purdue‚Äôs International Peer Mentoring Program, fostering an inclusive environment.
        <br>
        - Interned at <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Aider Ventures</span>, where I developed scalable pipelines and interactive dashboards to analyze <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>10,000+ research papers</span>.
        <br>
        - Worked as a Business Analyst Intern at the <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Legislative Services Agency</span>, supporting Indiana lawmakers with technical solutions.
        <br>
        - Lost over <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>100 pounds</span> in two years, reinforcing my belief in discipline, consistency, and resilience.
        <br><br>
        I thrive at the intersection of AI, data, and real-world impact, always looking for ways to turn complex problems into practical, scalable solutions.
