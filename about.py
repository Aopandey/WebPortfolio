        I wear multiple hats—part engineer, part problem solver. My journey from <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>India to Indiana</span> has been one of growth, resilience, and discovery, leading me to specialize in <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>AI-driven data pipelines</span>, <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>machine learning</span>, and <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>data engineering</span>. On the technical front, I build scalable ETL pipelines, optimize AI retrieval models, and design interactive data visualizations. The data-driven side of me focuses on structuring unstructured data, improving model accuracy, and bridging the gap between AI and business strategy.
        <br>
        My academic journey reflects my curiosity and adaptability. I earned a Bachelor’s degree in <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Computer Science</span> with a <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Minor in Mathematics</span> from <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Purdue University</span>, an achievement that once felt like a distant dream. Originally starting in Computer Engineering, I soon realized that Computer Science was my true passion, leading me to pivot and explore AI, data engineering, and large-scale data processing.
        <br><br>
        <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;'>Leadership & Projects</span>
        <br><br>
        - Co-founded the Computer Science Club at Purdue Indianapolis, increasing engagement by <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>100%</span> and organizing hackathons with <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>200+ participants</span>.
        <br>
        - Mentored <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>50+ international students</span> through Purdue’s International Peer Mentoring Program, fostering an inclusive environment.
        <br>
        - Interned at <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Aider Ventures</span>, where I developed scalable pipelines and interactive dashboards to analyze <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>10,000+ research papers</span>.
        <br>
        - Worked as a Business Analyst Intern at the <span style='color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;'>Legislative Services Agency</span>, supporting Indiana lawmakers with technical solutions.
        <br>
        - Lost over <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>100 pounds</span> in two years, reinforcing my belief in discipline, consistency, and resilience.
        <br><br>
        I thrive at the intersection of AI, data, and real-world impact, always looking for ways to turn complex problems into practical, scalable solutions.

        Beyond my work in AI and data science, I have a deep love for sports, creativity, and adventure. You’ll often find me:
        <br><br>
        - <strong>⚽ Playing or watching soccer (football)</strong> — A lifelong passion, always cheering for <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>Messi &amp; Barcelona</span>.
        <br>
        - <strong>🏋️ Working out</strong> — Fitness has been a huge part of my journey, helping me develop discipline and focus.
        <br>
        - <strong>🎮 Diving into video games</strong> — From immersive story-mode RPGs to fast-paced FPS games.
        <br>
        - <strong>⛰️ Hiking &amp; bouldering</strong> — Always looking for new trails and climbing routes to challenge myself.
        <br>
        - <strong>🎬 Watching anime &amp; Star Wars</strong> — Whether it’s the latest Shonen series or a rewatch of <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>The Mandalorian</span>.
        <br>
        - <strong>👟 Collecting sneakers</strong> — Because a fresh pair of kicks is always a good idea.
        <br>
        - <strong>🎵 Listening to music (rap &amp; hip-hop)</strong> — <span style='color:#FF6347; font-weight:bold;'>Kanye, Kendrick</span> and classic 2000s beats keep me inspired.
        <br><br>
        No matter what I’m doing—whether coding, climbing, or competing—I bring the same energy: a drive to push boundaries, learn, and grow.
